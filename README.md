# Machine-Learning-DevOps-Engineer-Udacity-Nanodegree
Projects worked in order to complete the Machine Learning DevOps Engineer nanodegree program offered by Udacity. Nanodegree website: https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-dev-ops-engineer-nanodegree--nd0821
## Overview
The Machine Learning DevOps Engineer Nanodegree program focuses on the software engineering fundamentals needed to successfully streamline the deployment of data and machine learning models in a production-level environment. Nanodegree students build the DevOps skills required to automate the various aspects and stages of machine learning model building and monitoring over time.
## Nanodegree Program Objectives
Program graduates have demonstrated the ability to:
* Implement production-ready Python code/processes for deploying ML models outside of cloud-based environments facilitated by tools such as AWS SageMaker, Azure ML, etc.
* Engineer automated data workflows that perform continuous training (CT) and model validation within a CI/CD pipeline based on updated data versioning.
* Create multi-step pipelines that automatically retrain and deploy models after data updates.
* Track model summary statistics and monitor model online performance over time to prevent model-degradation.
